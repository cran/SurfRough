Venice 14 December 2022 update 30 July 2024 (reduced the size of testfiles).

Here there are input files and output files (from R output) to be used for testing purposes,
whenever you change something in the code (a more robust testing framework will be designed...when I have time...)
input files: residual.tif and trento1.tif (Lidar DTM from the Province of Trento cartographic service (“Ufficio Sistemi Informativi - Servizio autorizzazioni e valutazioni ambientali”) available at this link:
http://www.territorio.provincia.tn.it/portal/server.pt/community/lidar/847/lidar/23954
These are available with creative common license

output files: all the others.

See script testingSurf.R on how to perform the test.
